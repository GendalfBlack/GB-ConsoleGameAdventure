# GB-ConsoleGameAdventure
Simple small text RPG game using only console c++.

The goal is to make small text adventure game with not a lot on depth, but make it as simple as possible without using advanced level tools of c++.
Showing this project to the students and make it some interesting to watch and play.

Story tailing inspired Tolkien world of Lord of the Rings and Hobbit and in future plans to follow the books. 
If we'll be there, there is a chance to add a console characters art, and maybe some variety of story events.

Feel free to suggesting storyline changes if you have any ideas! (If there even will be any :D)
